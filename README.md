Santander project mission is to help people and businesses prosper.
Here we are always looking for ways to help customers and business
prosper and achieve their monetary goal.
In this challenge, we need to identify which customers will make a
specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of
mon ey transacted. The given dataset is split into train and test data.
The dataset we are provided with has an anonymized numeric feature
variables, the binary target column, and a string ID_code column.
The task is to predict the value of target column in the test set by
training our train data on various Machine Learning Algorithms.
The process of building the model start from basic u se of basic
algorithms l ike Logistic Regression and after that we used four
different algorithms which are Decision trees, Random Forest,
KNN( K Nearest Neighbour ) and Na√Øve Bayes to develop our model
and predict target variable. For Classification the Accuracy metrics
we considered are AUC, Precision & Recall
